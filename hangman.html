    <p class="clicktoopen">Unfortunately, Heroku very recently deleted databases as
      a result of the termination of free plans, and this site was a victim of that,

    <h2>Online Hangman</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="summary">This is an online Hangman game with a twist. There are different themes you
      can utilize, which correspond to certain categories of words and fun unique
      outfits for the man. There is also a two-player option, so you can play with
      a friend, and a leaderborad, so you can compete to achieve the highest scores.
      I collaborated on this project with two other team members during a summer
      internship with CDK Global.</p>
