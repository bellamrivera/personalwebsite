    <h2>Match the Munchies</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="summary">This is a classic online matching/memorization game. The goal of the game is
      to find all the pairs of matching snacks until the board is clear. This project
      was done individually as a creative assignment for a web development course that
      I took as a student at the University of Washington.

          what type of project to create through which implementthat criteria
          (i.e. at least one event handler function should change the DOM, or
          modify a classList of an element)

        <td class="description">I developed this project for an introductory course,
          so I wasn't very familiar with web development. Some of the functionality
          required skills that I didn't yet have in my toolbox, so I had to utilize
          online documentation, tutorials, and find workarounds using the knowledge
          I had to bring this webpage together.
